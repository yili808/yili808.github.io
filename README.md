### [Scene Text Recognition](https://yili808.github.io/CV-NLP/Scene_Text_Recognition_YiLi.pdf) 2021-06
A technical report/research on Scence Text Detection and Recognition. 
Papers coverd in the slides: 
- Scene Text Recognition:
  - CRNN (CNN + BiLSTM + CTC loss)
  - ASTER (Spatial Transformer Networks + CNN + BiLSTM + Attention-Based Decoder)
  - MORAN (Pixel-Level Rectification + CNN + BiLSTM + Attention-Based Decoder) 
  - TextScanner (Segmentation-Based with Mutual-Supervision Mechanism)

- Scene Text Detection:
  - DB-Net: Differentiable Binarization (use segmentation-based methods for detection)

- OCR System
  - PP-OCR: A	Practical	Ultra	Lightweight	OCR	System from	Baidu	Inc. 
    
    Main idea: 1 Detector + 1 Text Box Rectifier + N Recognizer (for recognizing multiple languages).


Keywords: OCR, Scene Text Detection, Scene Text Recognition.

### [Face recognition with Eigenfaces](https://yili808.github.io/EigenFaces/) 2017-11
Use PCA to do dimension reduction on 400 face images (each one has 10304 pixels) to find the top k eigenfaces. After compressing images (dimension reduction), use euclidian distance to find the most similar face image of a given face image in the database.
